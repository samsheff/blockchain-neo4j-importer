# Blockchain Importer for Neo4j
A node.js script for pulling data from blockchain.info into a neo4j instance for analysis

This is not complete, but under active development

Currently, it pulls only the block info from blockchain.info into neo4j and creates relationships between blocks. In the near future, it will also pull addresses and transactions and create relationships for those.
